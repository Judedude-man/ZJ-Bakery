        <h1>The ZJ Bakery was originally a small food truck that sold small goods such as tacos and burgers. Soon Jude and Izaiah were tired of the greasy tacos and the dirty stoves. Soon Jude had an idea and made a cupcake, they sold the cupcake for $2.99 and the next morning people were going crazy over their cupcakes. Soon they made so much money they upgraded their building and bought an abandoned school and transformed it into their new bakery and allowed other small buisinesses pay us to put their own little shops in the spots as if it was a mall. And after all the years, the shop started in 2004 and is still open today!</h1>
